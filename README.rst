Python Very Bad Things
======================

A little set of code snippets to do bad thing to the cpython interpreter.

I mainly use ctypes to this things and when is posible i will try to make it funny.

The idea is to learn by breaking, one of the more funny ways of learning something.

Rules to contribute
-------------------

* Don't break real things (Respect the machine of the code executors).
* Don't repeat existing scripts.
* All PR must be with only 1 commit and only 1 script.
